Project: Flappy Bird in Terminal

Recording: [Video Overview Here]()

## Project Objective

The original objective of this project was to simulate the popular mobile game, "Flappy Bird", in the terminal. The plan was to expand beyond the scope of the last project, "Stock Simulator", by implementing adjustable difficulty settings, a highscore tracker, and a permanant score board. Due to time constraints and unforseen technical difficulties, however, a scoreboard was unable to be inplemented.

## Project Takeaways

- The largest hurdle by far was trying to research a way to clear the terminal screen in order to sequentially display frames to mimic motion. Much time was devoted to searching webforums for non-OS specific methods of clearing the terminal, and I eventually was able to stumble upon ANSI escape codes, which was more preferable to using Window's system commands.

- The next largest hurdle was actually creating the game. Rendering a "viewing frame" and the "flappy bird" with ascii characters was easy enough, as well as simulating implementing simple physics like gravity and collision for said "flappy bird". Pipe dynamic generation, deletion, and rendering however, was far more difficult to plan and create, and required extensive time to debug and plan

- Over the course of the project, a large amount

- Creating a simple difficult using enumerations as well.
