# CIS 25 Source Code Repo

Welcome! This is where all the source code I've written for BCC's CIS 25 course lies.

## Directory Key

### Classwork
Any assignments that are done in class and not submitted to canvas are stored in the "classwork" folder.

### Homework
Any assignments that are submitted on Canvas for points are stored in the "homework" folder.

### Projects
Any project submissions are stored in the "project" folder for archival's sake.

## Additional Note
Loose assignment files (cs25_a##) from 03-15 and cs25_hw01 are left out of the folder's in order to maintain the links posted on the Canvas assignment submission.
